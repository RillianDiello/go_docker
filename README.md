This challenge is very exciting, especially if you have never worked with the Go language before!
You will need to publish an image on Docker Hub. When we execute:

We must get the following result: Full Cycle Rocks!!

If you notice, this image only prints the message as the final result, so it’s worth checking out the Go Lang website to learn how to create a "Hello World" program.

Remember that Go Lang has official ready-to-use images, so it’s worth consulting Docker Hub.

The image of our Go project must be less than 2MB. =)
Tip: In the introductory video about Docker, when we talked about the layered file system, I presented a "base" image. It might be a good idea to use it.

Upload the project to a remote Git repository and include the link to the image you uploaded to Docker Hub.

Share the link to the remote Git repository so we can review your project.

Have fun!
